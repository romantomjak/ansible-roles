powerdns_recursor_dnssec:
  # A path to a zone file to read trust anchors from. This can be used to read
  # distribution provided trust anchors, as for instance /usr/share/dns/root.key
  # from Debian's dns-root-data package.
  trustanchorfile: /usr/share/dns/root.key

powerdns_recursor_recordcache:
  # A query for which there is authoritatively no answer is cached to quickly deny
  # a record’s existence later on, without putting a heavy load on the remote server.
  # In practice, caches can become saturated with hundreds of thousands of hosts which
  # are tried only once. This setting, which defaults to 3600 seconds, puts a maximum
  # on the amount of time negative entries are cached.
  max_negative_ttl: 3600

  # Sets the ‘refresh almost expired’ percentage of the record cache. Whenever a
  # record is fetched from the packet or record cache and only refresh-on-ttl-perc
  # percent or less of its original TTL is left, a task is queued to refetch the
  # name/type combination to update the record cache. In most cases this causes
  # future queries to always see a non-expired record cache entry. A typical value
  # is 10. If the value is zero, this functionality is disabled.
  refresh_on_ttl_perc: 10

  # Queries for zones listed here will be forwarded to the IP address listed. Forwarded
  # queries have the recursion desired (RD) bit set to 0, meaning that this setting is
  # intended to forward queries to authoritative servers. If an NS record set for a
  # subzone of the forwarded zone is learned, that record set will be used to determine
  # addresses for name servers of the subzone. This allows e.g. a forward to a local
  # authoritative server holding a copy of the root zone, delegations received from
  # that server will work.

  forward_zones: []

  # Like regular recursor.forward_zones, but forwarded queries have the recursion
  # desired (RD) bit set to 1, meaning that this setting is intended to forward
