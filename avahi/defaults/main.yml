# services on all networks connected to the gateway. The gateway is somewhat
# intelligent and should work with all kinds of mDNS traffic, though some
# functionality is lost (specifically the unicast reply bit, which is used
# rarely anyway). Make sure to not run multiple reflectors between the same
# networks, this might cause them to play Ping Pong with mDNS packets.
