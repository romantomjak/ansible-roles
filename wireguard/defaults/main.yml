# Peer configuration.
#
# This works for both "servers" and "clients". When sending packets,
# the list of allowed IPs behaves as a sort of routing table, and when
# receiving packets, the list of allowed IPs behaves as a sort of
# access control list.
#
# Name property is entirely optional and when specified will add a
# comment in the configuration file above the peer definition to
# simplify peer identification later on.
#
# Peer configuration on a server might look like this:
#   wireguard_peers:
#     - name: client1
#       public_key: GtL7fZc/bLnqZldpVofMCD6hDjrK28SsdLxevJ+qtKU=
#       allowed_ips:
#         - 0.0.0.0/0
#         - 10.192.122.3/32
#
# Client configuration is very similiar with the addition of endpoint
# key wich is the internet IP of the remote peer:
#   wireguard_peers:
#     - public_key: HIgo9xNzJMWLKASShiTqIybxZ0U3wGLiUeJ1PKf8ykw=
#       endpoint: 192.95.5.69:51820
#       allowed_ips:
#         - 0.0.0.0/0
