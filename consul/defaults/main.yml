# Controls whether an agent is in server or client mode.

# The data center in which the agent is running. In most cases, a Consul
# datacenter is a single physical datacenter or a cloud region. The underlying
# philosophy is that a Consul datacenter is a LAN construct and is optimized
# for LAN latency.

# The retry_join parameter allows you to configure all Consul agents to
